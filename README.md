Gradebook Dynamics - Gradebook Dynamics was my senior project. It is a digital curriculum platform that was conceived and developed over the duration of two semesters. 
It’s a multi-tiered system that provides teachers the ability to utilize tablet based educational games in the classroom. Consisting of an admin panel (browser client) 
from which teachers can monitor and assess student performance using game results that are stored on google’s cloud datastore. Additionally teachers can control the 
launching or closing of games on each student tablet (Android client) from the admin panel.  

Uses: Android SDK, Java, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, XML, SQL.
